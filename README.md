My chosen examples of Creative Coding outputs from across the course.

Week 4 - pj.5s - Barcode

This is a simple output that randomises a for loop to create a unique barcode template every time it loops.
I chose this code as I really like the minimal imagery, and as basic as it is I enjoyed setting it up and it helped me wrap my head around for loops which are an integral part of efficiently utilising pj.5s.

Week 5 - pj.5s - Satisfying Spheres

A development on a previous output that combines increment operations and if statements to move the circles and bounce them both on separate axis. Noise is used to determine the colour of each circle without them lining up and being the same.
This one is just satisfying to look at, as well as the fact that I managed to figure out how to sync up the movements myself without outside input.

Week 6 - pj.5s - Record

My first time using the translate and rotate functions, which I had a limited understanding of at the time since I missed the class they were explored in. I still really like the final image but I wish I could have figured out how to use a for loop for the grooves, using individual circles was time consuming and looks messy in the final code.
But I think it speaks to my hobby of vinyl collection in a way I found fun to work with.

Week 8 - TouchDesigner - Ripples

One of the first TD outputs I really enjoyed making, using noise and feedback loops combined together to make this blobby, bouncy visual using dark circles with HSV adjust to change the outline colours.
The interplay of colour and gradients here I absolutely love, its fun to watch and makes for striking abstract imagery.

Week 9 - TouchDesigner - Ghosts

Its not very complex, and I still don't really know what the feedback adds to the final output, but it uses noise, edge, level, and multiple composites to make these floating ethereal figures.
The final gif looks interesting to me, with the blobs reminding me of the humanity ghosts from the Dark Souls games, and the faint colour really adds to the otherworldly aesthetic.

Week 11 - TouchDesigner - Entity

Using twist on a line material sphere, animating the twists and scales for this erratic movements with an audio input that has an adjusted range to better translate into movements. Edge and bloom TOP's were also used to enhance the look of the final image.
I approached this with a concept behind it of an immaterial creature, desperately trying to escape a confined space, so I added the text as a way of showing it as some sort of archival footage.
